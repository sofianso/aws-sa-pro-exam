# High Performance Computing

You can increase the bandwidth between EC2 instances by using Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) which will allow up to 1000 Gbps.

You can even go further by using Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) which is an improve ENA for HPC. However, it is limited to Linux. It is great for tight coupled workloads.

FSx for Lustre is suitable for HPC.
