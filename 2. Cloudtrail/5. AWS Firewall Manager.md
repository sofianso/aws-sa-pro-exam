# AWS Firewall Manager

##### What's the difference between AWS WAF and AWS Firewall Manager?
- You can define your Web ACL rules in WAF. In addition, for granular protection of your resources, WAF alone is the correct choice.
- However, if you want to use AWS WAF across accounts, accelerate WAF configuration, automate the protection of new resources, use Firewall Manager with AWS WAF.

##### Why AWS Shield?

Shield Advanced adds additional features on top of AWS WAF, such as dedicated support from the Shield Response Team (SRT) and advanced reporting. If you're prone to DDoS attacks, then consider using purchasing shield advanced.
