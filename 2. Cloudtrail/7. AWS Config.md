# AWS Config

AWS Config helps record configurations and changes over time.
Questions that AWS Config can answer:
1. Is there unrestricted SSH access to my security groups?
2. Do my buckets have any public access?
3. How has my ALB configuration changed over time?

You can receive alerts (SNS notifications) for any changes.

AWS Config is per-region service and can be aggregated across regions and accounts.
