# IAM

Short-term credential uses STS, for long-term credential use IAM users.

You want to use least privilege when creating a role or user. Use Access Advisor to see which permissions are granted and when last acccessed.
Use Access Analyzer to analyze resources that shared with external entities..

The major difference between assuming IAM roles and resource based policies is that when you assume a role that you give up all of your original permissions. When you use a resource based policy you get additional permissions on top of your original permissions.
